**In the name of Allah, the most merciful and the most compassionate**

It is with immense pleasure and pride that I extend to you a warm welcome to the National University of Modern Languages (NUML), an institution that stands as a beacon of educational excellence and innovation in Pakistan.

From its humble origins as a language institute in 1969, NUML has evolved into a distinguished university renowned for its diverse array of programs spanning Languages, Computer Sciences, Management Sciences, and Social Sciences. Our journey has been marked by a relentless pursuit of academic excellence, a commitment to knowledge-driven approaches, and a dedication to fostering innovative thinking among our students and faculty.

As we stand at the threshold of the sixth Industrial Revolution, NUML finds itself at the forefront of addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by this rapidly evolving global landscape. Our academic programs are meticulously designed to equip our students with the skills, knowledge, and mindset needed to thrive in an increasingly interconnected and dynamic world.

However, at NUML, our mission extends beyond mere academic and professional success. We are deeply committed to nurturing empathetic, disciplined, and ethically grounded individuals who are not only equipped to excel in their chosen fields but also to make meaningful contributions to society.

NUML was first created as a National Institute for Modern Languages, which, not only became a well known name for learning contemporary languages but graduated to become a full-fledged university in almost all the disciplines ranging from IT and Engineering to a large variety of social science subjects for under-graduates, as well as post-graduate students. The NUML’s vibrant students and alumni consists of learners from all parts of the country as well as from around the globe.

We have also taken a great stride in conducting research by adopting state of the art ICT methods. NUML’s research scholars’ work has been published and acknowledged nationally as well as internationally. Our MPhil and PhD programmes are drawing large number of scholars in almost all disciplines.

Provision of quality education is the most important ingredient of our mission that lies at the heart of our eminently qualified faculty. The establishment of Quality Enhancement Cell (QEC) and the Human Resource Development Centre (HRDC) together with Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialization (ORIC) with the collaboration of HEC, are the landmark milestones to achieving excellence in research, innovation and professional development of the faculty.
